# Add Named Anchors

The idea of creating this script came when I wanted to increase compatibility of my cheatsheet that you can also find on github. 
In fact, some markdown viewers needs named anchors to navigate properly through the document. But my (no really) cheatsheet, at the time I created this script, was around 6000 lines. Really, I didn't want to edit all the links manually.  
Well, with a bit of research on the documentation, I managed to do that script that takes on option the file path. It also checks that the extension is markdown.  
You also can see that a tiny documentation is included. :)
```
python add_named_anchors -f file.md
```
```
python add_named_anchors --help
```
